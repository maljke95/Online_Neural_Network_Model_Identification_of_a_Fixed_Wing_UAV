# Online Neural Network Model Identification of a Fixed-Wing UAV, Semester project ETH Zurich
Autonomous Systems Lab (ASL)

Description: Developed a Neural Network based system identification algorithm to predict the longitudinal dynamics of a
fixed-wing UAV in real time. A PX4 autopilot in a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation provided data via
the MAVROS plugin for the learning framework implemented in PyTorch.
